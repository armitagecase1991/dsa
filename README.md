# Java Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is dedicated to implementing and practicing various algorithms and data structures in Java. It serves as a resource for learning, practicing, and demonstrating efficient programming techniques using fundamental computer science concepts.

## Purpose
The main goals of this repository are:
- To provide implementations of classic and modern algorithms.
- To demonstrate the usage of different data structures in Java.
- To improve problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithm design and analysis.
- To serve as a reference for interview preparation and competitive programming.

## Features
- Implementations of common data structures such as:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - HashMaps, TreeMaps, and more.
- Algorithms for:
  - Searching (Binary Search, Linear Search, etc.)
  - Sorting (Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.)
  - Dynamic Programming (Knapsack, Fibonacci, etc.)
  - Greedy Algorithms
  - Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS, etc.)
- Examples of real-world problem-solving techniques.
